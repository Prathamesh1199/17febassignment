    "7:In MongoDB, delete_one(), delete_many(), and drop() are methods used to remove\n",
    "documents and collections from a database. Here's a brief explanation of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.delete_one() - This method is used to delete a single document that matches a specified \n",

    "2.delete_many() - This method is used to delete all documents that match a specified filter.\n",
    "3.drop() - This method is used to delete an entire collection from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "  These methods are useful for managing the data in a MongoDB database. For example,\n",
    "we might use delete_one() or delete_many() to remove documents that are no longer\n",
